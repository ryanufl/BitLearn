# BitLearn
Chrome extension tasked with making Bitcoin more accessible, relatable, and usable for everyone!

# How to Test
In order to test, go to chrome://extensions, load unpacked(in the top left, toggle dev mode to true in the top right first), and select the BitLearn folder. Reload the extension each time you update a file in it by pressing refresh button in lower right corner of extension block.



## Inspiration
With Bitcoin's popularity and mobility it's time to establish a decentralized currency as another way of payment. By using this extension, easily become familiar with Bitcoin prices and how much Bitcoin every day items cost. Simply seeing the numbers and comparing them to prices helps to drive familiarity, and help destroy the myth of a complicated systems that is hard to use.
## What it does
Modifies each webpage's DOM to choose between seeing prices in Bitcoin, USD, or both, while also providing the current Bitcoin price and access to learning materials.
## How we built it
Using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, we procedurally implemented designs and were able to test the progress as we went along.
## Challenges we ran into
With **three of us being first-time hackers**, and one of those three a Business Technology major, the technical rigor and timing was harder than expected, as well as having to delay certain features for future development. Working with GitHub to share code sometimes left us with a little messy merges, and combining features proved to be the final struggle.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of being able to have a completed product that could be ready for the Chrome Store, and knowing that we tried our hardest while also having a blast.
## What we learned
We learned tons about HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and a decent amount of Chrome extension specifics, such as background scripts, messaging, and error debugging.
## What's next for BitLearn
BitLearn has an ambitious future, including features such as Bitcoin historical price, bitcoin price alerts, MetaMask integration, and an expanded learning-based rewards system.
